![The Curator's House and Visitor Centre](curators-house.jpg)

The Curators House was built in 1840, and is still known by
this name. It was designed by [Charles Wilson][1],
a central figure in the
development of Glasgow's architecture and town planning in the mid
19th century.

[Charles Wilson][1] is buried in the Southern Necropolis and his Obelisk is
a feature of the Southern Necropolis Heritage Trail.
