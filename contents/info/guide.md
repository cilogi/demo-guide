# Using this guide

This guide is a mobile web application and can be used like any other
web application.  It does have some special features though, some of
which may not be obvious.

* If you bookmark the guide you can access it even when you're
  offline inside a building or outside 3G or WiFi range.
* Whenever you see a grid icon with a number, if you hit the `Keypad`
  menu item at the top of the screen and type the number into the
  keypad you will be taken to information about the item associated
  with that number.
* You can tap most images to get a larger view, which you can pan by
  touching and moving, and scale by pinch zoom (where available).
* Some items are part of tours.  You'll see an active (not grayed out)
  tour menu item in the top menu when you're on a tour and can choose
  this menu item to get an overview of the tour.
* The menu bar below contains all the common menus

From left to right these are:
  
* _Menu_. Top level menu, available from every page.
* _Keypad_. When you press this you can type in the index of
  an exhibit to be taken directly to it..
* _Shop_.  If the cart is red takes you to items particularly
    appropriate for the current page (see the
    [Kibble Palace](page/3) entry for an
    example). Otherwise brings up the shop.
* _Tour_.  Some pages are part of a larger tour.  If the page you
    are on is part of a tour then touching this menu item will take
    you to the tour home page.  See
    [the Botanics trail](tour/botanics-trail) for an example tour.
* _Map_. Some items, which have a physical location, can be viewed on a
    map. A guide can have several maps, but each map item occurs on
    only one map.  If you touch the map button the item's map will be
    shown, with the item in solid blue.  Other items will be
    semi-transparent. If you go to the map directly (i.e.
    [here](map/map1) all items are visible.
    Information items which pop up information when you touch them are
