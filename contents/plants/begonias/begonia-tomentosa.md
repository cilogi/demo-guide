# Begonia tomentosa


![Begonia tomentosa](images/begonia-tomentosa.jpg)

This bushy begonia has attractive foliage with felt-like leaves. The
many flowers are pink with white edges and red hairs, blooming in
May. Stemming is upright and zig-zag between the nodes. Pinching tips
and pruning outer stems in the growing season gives a bushier plant,
good for hanging. This plant enjoys filtered light but can take some
sun in winter. Soil should ideally be moist.
