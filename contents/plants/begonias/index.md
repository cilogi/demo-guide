# Begonias

![Begonia Ulmifolia from Hooker's Exotic Flora](images/begonia-ulmifolia.jpg)

About 1000 begonia species are found growing wild in the tropics and
sub-tropics of the world.  In addition the creation of many hybrids
has greatly increased the variety of begonias in cultivation.  they
vary in size from dwarf up to giants with woody stems 6m tall.

Although many prefer shady conditions, especially those grown for
their beautiful leaves, others thrive in bright light.  Begonia leaves
are usually asymmetrical, with one side longer then the other.  The
flowers are separately male and female on the same plant and may
differ in size.  The National Collection of Begonias which is grown
here in the Botanic Gardens, illustrates their diversity.
