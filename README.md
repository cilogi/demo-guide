* Demo Cilogi Site

This is a demo site, containing just enough information to show the various features of guides.

The guide is re-built whenever changes are pushed to the master branch of this repository using
Github's [web hooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/).

At the moment this is not a public facility.
