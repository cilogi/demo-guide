    "description": "The Gardens contains the National Begonia Collection. About 1000 begonia species are found growing wild in the tropics and sub-tropics of the world.  In addition the creation of many hybrids has greatly increased the variety of begonias in cultivation.  they vary in size from dwarf up to giants with woody stems 6m tall.\n\n Although many prefer shady conditions, especially those grown for their beautiful leaves, others thrive in bright light.  Begonia leaves are usually asymmetrical, with one side longer then the other.  The flowers are separately male and female on the same plant and may differ in size.  The National Collection of Begonias which is grown here in the Botanic Gardens, illustrates their diversity.",
